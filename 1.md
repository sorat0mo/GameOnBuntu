# Installing
Ubuntu 21.04 will install just fine with latest Linux kernel. No fuss.
However with Kubuntu 21.04, when you try booting up after installation you may face a problem where Kubuntu does not launch and you are stuck at your MoBo's splash logo.
As it did with mine. I am not sure if this is a widespread issue or just me alone. But I got it fixed by booting up to recovery mode, updating everything, and rebooting. Not sure why it wasn't enough installing updates alongside the OS, but it worked for me.

# Prerequisites
You need a few things to make gaming on Linux a joyous experience.

### 1. Feral Gamemode

This will defer system resources to your game, attaining optimal performance when gaming. It is included by default in Ubuntu now. But *not* in Kubuntu, nor is it in KDE Neon.

To install it, do `sudo apt install gamemode`

### 2. Mangohud and GOverlay

Afterburner and Rivatuner is not on Linux, but there is a replacement for the huds. Mangohud replicates that of afterburner and looks pretty good out of the box.

Goverlay is the GUI for configuring mangohud. Keep in mind though, the goverlay version in main Ubuntu repo is **outdated**, so use the author's repo instead:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:flexiondotorg/mangohud
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install goverlay
```
This will install goverlay, mangohud and a few other dependencies.

### 3. Lutris

Lutris is an open source platform for organizing your games. It also makes installing non-Steam, non-Linux games much easier through community installers. I highly recommend using it to simplify installing non-Steam games.

To install:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lutris-team/lutris
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lutris
```

### 4. Wine and dependencies

This is recommended to maximize wine performance and compatibility. Installing these also allows you to run \*.exe executables and games such as RPGM games not on Steam.

```
wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key
sudo apt-key add winehq.key
sudo apt-add-repository 'https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-staging
sudo apt install winetricks
rm winehq.key
```

### 5. Proton-GE and Wine-GE

These are authored by [@GloriousEggRoll](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll) and come in handy whenever lutris-wine or Steam Proton refuse to work whatsoever.

Refer to the *Native* and *Release Installation* in [GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) and [GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom) respectively.

### 6. Nvidia X Server Settings

This is a frustrating piece of crap that I hope I never had to deal with. Whoever wrote this software does not respect user experience and makes it frustrating to use. By frustrating I mean it does not save fan speed controls and powermizer(overclocking) configurations by default.

1. Do the following: `sudo nvidia-settings`, this will open nvidia-settings with root privileges.
2. Configure everything in X Server Display Configuration, and hit **Save to X configuration file**
3. Configure X Screen settings.
4. Configure Fan speed and Powermizer.
5. Make sure you disabled *Include X Display Names in the Config file*
6. Hit *Save Current Configuration* in the tab *nvidia-settings Configuration*
7. Open the saved file and add the following

```
[fan:0]/GPUCurrentFanSpeed=70
[fan:1]/GPUCurrentFanSpeed=70
[gpu:0]/GPUPowerMizerMode=1
```

It detected my card has 2 controllable fans (although it is a 3 fans card), so I put `fan:0` and `fan:1`, if it detects more, just add more. Same with `gpu:0`. PowerMizerMode 1 is "Prefer Maximize Performance".

Save the file and make a startup command like this: `nvidia-settings --load-config-only`. If your distro/flavour does not support startup commands(like Kubuntu), make a bash and just add it as login script.
