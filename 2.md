## PulseEffects
PulseEffects may or may not have bugs depending on your distro, for me, it couldn't properly load and use presets. Rendering my Mono-downmixing settings useless.

**First**, according to [This Post](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/05/pulseeffects-nice-system-wide.html), PulseAudio by default may switch to a wrong output device when PulseEffects is enabled, which is undesired. To fix this:

1. Unload the module `module-switch-on-connect` with `pactl unload-module module-switch-on-connect`
2. Write it permanently with:
   ```bash
   cp /etc/pulse/default.pa ~/.config/pulse
   sed -i 's/load-module module-switch-on-connect/#load-module module-switch-on-connect/g' ~/.config/pulse/default.pa
   ```

For KDE, you may also need to unload `module-device-manager`, however, it wasn't loaded for me by default, but give it a try nonetheless:

1. `pactl unload-module module-device-manager`
2. `echo "pactl unload-module module-device-manager > /dev/null 2>&1" >> ~/.bashrc`

The above was supposed to be fixed with newer PulseAudio and PulseEffects versions, but apparently I still had this problem.

**Second**, for some reason PulseEffects refuse to load presets if you start it with just `pulseeffects --gapplication-service` or `pulseeffects --gapplication-service -l abcd`. I tried lots of hacks to fix it, and came across the fix as a simple but effective bash script.

According to one of the replies in [this issues](https://githubmemory.com/repo/wwmm/pulseeffects/issues/952), the following commands are needed:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
(pulseeffects --gapplication-service &)
sleep 1
pulseeffects -l Blankkk
sleep 1
pulseeffects -l OMG
```

Where `Blankkk` denotes a *completely blank* preset and `OMG` denotes your desired preset. Thankfully, the save preset feature still works to an extent.

## XanMod Kernel
The [XanMod Kernel](https://xanmod.org/) is a custom kernel that keeps up-to-date with the latest kernel version and adds its own patch and tweaks for a smoother and faster Linux computing experience. The fact that Ubuntu and its derivatives stay behind with an older kernel (5.13 at the time of writing) forbid using fsync to improve and stabalize in-game performance. The XanMod Kernel is specifically compiled for Debian based distros, and is available for Ubuntu flavours.

To install, following the [Install via Terminal](https://xanmod.org/#install_via_terminal) guide found on XanMod Kernel official website.
To verify you correctly installed the kernel after reboot, issue the command `hostnamectl` in terminal.
